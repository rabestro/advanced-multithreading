= Task 6: Producer-Consumer Multi-threading

== Task Description

Create a multi-threading console application that starts two threads for producer and consumer respectively. The producer generates random numbers, and the consumer calculates their total average. There must be a graceful shutdown, allowing threads to correctly finish their work. When both producer and consumer are stopped, print to the console the number of operations performed per second (ops/sec). This task should be implemented using two approaches:

1. Classic model: Use a non-blocking Queue implementation (e.g., LinkedList) to share data between producer and consumer threads. Use the synchronized block, wait()/notify() methods to guard the queue from simultaneous access.
2. Concurrency: Use java.util.concurrent package classes for synchronization (BlockingQueue, locks, etc.).

After both versions are complete, compare their performance (ops/sec).

== Solution Description

The solution implements two versions of the Producer-Consumer problem:

1. In the Classic Model, we use `synchronized`, `wait()`, and `notify()` to implement a shared `LinkedList` as a queue between the producer and consumer threads.
2. In the Concurrency Model, we utilize a `BlockingQueue` from the `java.util.concurrent` package to handle synchronization between the producer and consumer threads.

Both implementations start two threads: one producer and one consumer. The producer generates random numbers and adds them to the shared queue, while the consumer consumes the numbers from the same queue.

After running both implementations, you can compare their performance (ops/sec).
