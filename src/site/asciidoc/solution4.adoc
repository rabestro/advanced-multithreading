= Task 4: Blocking Object Pool

== Task Description

The goal of this task is to create a simple object pool with support for a multithreaded environment. The pool should block if it has no available items or is full. The requirements are as follows:

* Implement a `BlockingObjectPool` class with a constructor that accepts the size of the pool as an argument.
* Implement a `get()` method that returns an object from the pool or blocks if the pool is empty.
* Implement a `take(Object object)` method that puts an object back into the pool or blocks if the pool is full.
* Ensure that the implementation is thread-safe and uses any blocking approach.

== Solution Description

Our solution uses a `LinkedBlockingQueue` to implement the object pool. When the `BlockingObjectPool` is created, the queue is initialized with the specified size and filled with new `Object` instances. The `LinkedBlockingQueue` provides blocking behavior internally, ensuring that our implementation is thread-safe and efficient.

Here is the implementation of the `BlockingObjectPool` class:

[source,java]
----
include::../../main/java/epam/task4/BlockingObjectPool.java[]
----

The `get()` method retrieves an object from the pool and blocks if the pool is empty until an object becomes available. Similarly, the `take(...)` method puts an object into the pool and blocks if the pool is full until there is space available. Both methods use the blocking methods of the `LinkedBlockingQueue`, namely `take()` and `put(...)`, which handle blocking and signaling internally.

If an interruption occurs during the `get()` or `take(...)` operations, the interrupted status of the current thread is preserved, allowing the caller to handle the interruption accordingly.
