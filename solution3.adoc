= Task 3: Where's Your Bus, Dude?

== Task Description

The objective of this task is to implement a message bus using the Producer-Consumer pattern with the following requirements:

1. Implement an asynchronous message bus without using any queue implementation from `java.util.concurrent`.
2. Implement a producer that generates and posts random messages to the queue.
3. Implement a consumer that consumes messages on specific topics and logs the message payload to the console.

(Optional)
4. The application should create several consumers and producers that run in parallel.

== Solution Description

The solution involves creating the following components:

1. The `Message` class representing a message with a `topic` and a `payload`.
2. A custom `MessageBus` queue class that implements the Producer-Consumer pattern.
3. A `Producer` class that generates and posts random messages to the queue.
4. A `Consumer` class that listens to specific topics and consumes messages from the queue.

To demonstrate the functionality, we create an application with multiple producers and consumers running in parallel.
